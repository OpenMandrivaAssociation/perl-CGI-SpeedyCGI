    # SpeedyBackendProg - Path to the speedy backend program.

    # SpeedyGroup - Allow a single perl interpreter to run multiple scripts.
    # All scripts that are run with the same group name and by the same user
    # will be run by the same group of perl interpreters. If the group name is
    # "none" then grouping is disabled and each interpreter will run one
    # script. Different group names allow scripts to be separated into
    # different groups. Name is case-sensitive, and only the first
    # 12-characters are significant. Specifying an empty group name is the same
    # as specifying the group name "default" - this allows just specifying "-g"
    # on the command line to turn on grouping.

    # SpeedyMaxBackends - If non-zero, limits the number of speedy backends
    # running for this perl script to <number>.

    # SpeedyMaxRuns - Once the perl interpreter has run <number> times, re-exec
    # the backend process. Zero indicates no maximum. This option is useful for processes that tend to consume resources over time.

    # SpeedyPerlArgs - Command-line options to pass to the perl interpreter.

    # SpeedyTimeout - If no new requests have been received after <number>
    # seconds, exit the persistent perl interpreter. Zero indicates no timeout.

    # SpeedyTmpBase - Use the given prefix for creating temporary files. This
    # must be a filename prefix, not a directory name.


    # This will allow execution of mod_speedycgi to make your webbased
    # perl-written applications much more quickly by keeping the perl
    # interpreter running.
